        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
          <li>Github is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely.</li>
          <li>While GitHub is popular, there are other Git-based repository hosting services, such as Bitbucket and SourceForge.</li>
          <li>Git commands are not the same as the bash commands.</li>
          <li>Git commands always start with git and are used to save and track versions of your code.</li>
          <li>Using Git commands, we can initiate (or create) a repo, add our code to the repo, and view the different versions of our code, which are each stored in a unique commit.</li>
          <li>Git is great for tracking changes locally on your own computer</li>
          <li>To collaborate with others, you need to use another tool, GitHub</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>The checkout command is to move the working branch to a new branch.</li>
          <li>The -b flag creates a new branch.</li>
          <li>The add command adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area.</li>
          <li>The -A flag indicates that we want to add all changes.</li>
          <li>The pull command is used to receive a branch's modifications into the local environment.</li>
          <li>The origin keyword indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo.</li>
          <li>The push command is used to push the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch.</li>
