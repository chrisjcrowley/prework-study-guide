        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users</li>
          <li>3 ways to style a wbepage using CSS:  inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>External style sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The symbol * applies a rule to all the elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li>The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup. </li>
          <li>A link element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The herf attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. </li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
          <li>Github is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely.</li>
          <li>While GitHub is popular, there are other Git-based repository hosting services, such as Bitbucket and SourceForge.</li>
          <li>Git commands are not the same as the bash commands.</li>
          <li>Git commands always start with git and are used to save and track versions of your code.</li>
          <li>Using Git commands, we can initiate (or create) a repo, add our code to the repo, and view the different versions of our code, which are each stored in a unique commit.</li>
          <li>Git is great for tracking changes locally on your own computer</li>
          <li>To collaborate with others, you need to use another tool, GitHub</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>The checkout command is to move the working branch to a new branch.</li>
          <li>The -b flag creates a new branch.</li>
          <li>The add command adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area.</li>
          <li>The -A flag indicates that we want to add all changes.</li>
          <li>The pull command is used to receive a branch's modifications into the local environment.</li>
          <li>The origin keyword indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo.</li>
          <li>The push command is used to push the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch.</li>
